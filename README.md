# Avocado Workshop

This project is a workshop focused on fetching data from an avocado API and manipulating the DOM.

## Description

In this workshop, we are using JavaScript to fetch data from an API that provides information about different types of avocados. We then create elements in the DOM to display this information, including titles, images, and descriptions.

## Features

- Fetching data from the avocado API
- Creating dynamic elements in the DOM
- Displaying avocado information (name, image, description)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once you open the `index.html` file, you will see a list of avocados displayed on the page. Each avocado is represented by a card with its name, image, and description.
